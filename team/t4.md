# Team Project 4: User Testing 1

Due Tuesday, November 11 at 1:59pm

In this assignment, you will test your paper prototypes with 3 users. You will collect feedback from users and write a report documenting the usability feedback you received.

## Expected time
Conducting the user studies will take 4-6 hours. Writing up the report will take an additional 2-4 hours.

## What to do
1. Conduct your user testing as outlined in [T3](t3.html). Make sure that you schedule your study sessions so that you can have one experimenter and one note taker. Make sure to take notes during the process and collect user feedback.
2. Write a report documenting your user test. This report should include the following information.

	- Title of your project and team members
	- Executive summary (1 paragraph) summarizing how your studies went and what you learned.
	- Description of the testing protocol (2-4 paragraphs), including any changes you made from the previous assignment.
	- Usability problems (no limit). Document each of the usability problems that came up during your test. You may use [Shaun's UAR template](../files/uar.docx) or modify it for your own uses.
	- Subjective feedback from users (no limit). Present any questionnaires they filled out and relevant quotes from their feedback.
	- List of proposed design changes (2 pages max). Based on your testing results and user feedback; provide a list of concrete changes that your group will make to your prototype to address the high level issues.
	- Contribution report (1 paragraph) describing what each member contributed to the project.
3. Executive summary slide. Create a single slide presenting a summary of your study, usability problems discovered, and your planned user interface changes. Post your slide to the [shared slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xMHt-Umao99I0gl5nc9YuW1n1YyW64O2X8o2ZjKfz20/edit?usp=sharing)

## What to turn in
You will post your research report on your project blog. You will post your executive summary slide on the [shared slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xMHt-Umao99I0gl5nc9YuW1n1YyW64O2X8o2ZjKfz20/edit?usp=sharing)
