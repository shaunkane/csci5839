# Assignment S1,S2,S3: Free Sketching

Due Monday, December 10 at 2pm (see details below)

Two important aspects of engaging in user-centered design are: 1) generating lots of ideas, and 2) expressing early ideas through sketches and other forms. To gain some practice in this type of activity, you will complete 3 mini sketching assignments throughout the semester.

There are 3 separate sketching assignments. However, there is no specific due date for any of these assignments. The only rules are as follows:

- You must submit all 3 assignments before our last class meeting (December 11)

## What do do
You will create a 1 to 2 page sketch of a new idea for some interactive system (desktop application, mobile app, wearable computing app, etc.). There is not a specific format for this assignment; however, it should include the following items:

- A statement of the **problem being solved** (in text, in a sketch, etc.)
- A depiction of the solution using a combination of *original* images and text. You should sketch out what the solution is and how it works. You can draw freehand, take original photos, and/or draw on your photos. You should not use existing images for this assignment.
- You should add a few brief notes on limitations of your solution, or potential concerns about the design. These should probably be in text, but feel free to illustrate them as well.

While we will spend time in class coming up with "wacky" design ideas (e.g., robotic shoes), the projects you turn in for this assignment should be plausible using current technology, or within the next 3-5 years. The purpose of requiring these projects to be plausible is to give you experience in considering the limitations or tradeoffs of real technologies.

## Example
[Here is an example sketch assignment](../files/pizza.png), sketched on paper and scanned in via my phone. This took about 15 minutes in total; you should spend more time and submit something better. :)

## Expected time
Varies. You might spend 1-2 hours producing the sketch, although you may spend much more time before that thinking about the idea and refining it in your head.

## What to turn in
Turn in your sketch at the start of class on paper, or upload a scanned version to the [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/#folders/0B-vRV62_RpG2d0FIdU5SaGNrOUE). You can scan your drawings using apps like 	[Genius Scan for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876?mt=8) or [CamScanner for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner&hl=en).

## Grading Guidelines

 | Criterion | Points | 
 | ---------|------- | 
 | Sketch clearly describes and illustrates a problem to be solved | 3 | 
 | Sketch describes and illustrates a creative solution to that problem | 3 | 
 | Sketch describes any limitations or remaining questions | 1 | 
 | Sketch is easy to read and understand | 3 | 
 | **Total** | **10** | 

To be clear, you will *not* be graded on your artistic ability, although you may lose some points if your drawing is excessively messy (on lined or torn paper, repeatedly erased and redrawn, etc.). You may need to complete your sketch once, then make an easier to read copy of it.
