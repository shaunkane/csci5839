# Team Project 7: Video Storyboards

Due Tuesday, December 2 at 1:59pm

For your final project assignment, you will submit a video In this assignment, you will create a storyboard for a video that will demonstrate your project in use.

For this video, you don't need to create a complete video, but can instead create a slideshow with narration (we will go over this in class). You may choose to shoot video for this assignment, or may wish to put together your video from images, screenshots, and drawings. Note that you must use original images for your video -- you should not take images from the internet for your video project.

## Expected time
This will probably take between 4 and 6 hours to complete. 

## What to do
For this part of the assignment, you will create a storyboard for your project video. This storyboard should tell a story that presents a user's problem or goal, and shows how the user uses your project to address that problem.

Here are some example videos from a prior version of this class: [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl0_bzNU3g&feature=youtu.be), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQUWGRdjxVo&feature=youtu.be), [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGToSffVmJY)

You should plan on making your video 5 minutes or less (but at least 1 minute).

For this assignment, you will create a storyboard for your video. This is effectively a draft of the video -- it should show all the major scenes of the video, and include any dialogue or narration as text. Your storyboard should be specific enough that you could hand it off to another person to create the video.

You should probably create your storyboard on paper, but you may use other tools as well.

## What to turn in
Upload your storyboard to your project blog as a series of images or a PDF. Include a paragraph describing who contributed what to this assignment.
